Task #1 description

We have in PostgreSQL tables like this:

auth_tokens table:
id BIGINT;
userid INT;
deviceid VARCHAR(255);
pushtoken VARCHAR(255);
devide_platform SMALLINT;

users table:
id BIGINT;
firstname VARCHAR(100);

device_platforms table:
id SMALLINT;
name VARCHAR(100);

User table has about 100 000 users, every user can have more than one device, so auth_tokens table will have size more than 100 000 rows as well.

Marketing team wants to send pushes to all users with ‘some text’. And they want to do it several times a week by some scheduled timetable. So for example send on Monday at 09:00am pushes with text ‘hello world’, on Tuesday 6:00pm ‘hello, how are you?’ etc. Max count of scheduled tasks will not be more than 10.

What we need from developer: please describe how to solve this task, we need detailed explanation of the flow + describing all technologies, frameworks and tools you prefer use to solve this task.

Feel free to contact our HR or other guys you have contacts with.


Solution:
First of all, as I have strong skills with Hibernate framework, Spring framework and JSF framework (primefaces), I would choose these frameworks for the software architecture. 
I would configure all these frameworks to work together. Then, I would map all tables from database and create layers for presentation, business and persistence. After that, I need a form to save all data input about the pushes we want to send as a schedule event. Then we can use Threats to configure all pushes that we want to create, also we can use NiconNotifyOSD, which it is a library for notifications and messaging service for java.
With all this framworks we can easily create an application with all the requirements that marketing team want.
